A simple tool for scons for building delphi projects.

dcc32.py provides the DelphiProject command to the scons tool set to
build classic delphi projects. The compilation is invoked by calling
dcc32 on the passed .dpr file.

Usage:
======

# --- Start of example
env=Environment( tools = ["default", "dcc32"],
                 toolpath = ["."] )

# ...

env.DelphiProject("myproject.dpr")
# --- End of example

The tool scans the .dpr file on whether it will result in a program or
a library and start to track the resulting .exe or .dll file
respectively. The user may provide command switches via the DCCFLAGS
environment variable.

If DCCFLAGS contains an -E switch, scons will track the target file in
the specified directory. If DCCFLAGS doesn't contain an -E switch, but
the .cfg file of the project does, it will use the -E switch in the
config file instead. Otherwise the tool assumes that the file will be
compiled into the current directory.

Dependency and change tracking:
===============================

Because dcc32 tracks dependencies during compilation, the scons tool
does not track any compilation results except the target
file. Therefore only the target file will be cleaned.
